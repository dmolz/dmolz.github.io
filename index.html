  <h1> Daniel Molzahn </h1>
  <p> I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York. My resume can be found <a href="Resume.pdf">here</a>. </p>
  
  <!--<p> After originally starting as a mechanical engineering major, I realized I had much more interest in programming than I did in engineering, so I switched majors at the end of my sophomore year and haven't looked back since. </p>

  <p> Right now, the goal of this website is to tell a little more about myself and showcase my work and skills. </p> -->

  <p> I'm from Monroe, NY. I played baseball and basketball in high school, and competed in cross country and track as well. I also was on the NCAA D3 track and field team at RPI, where I competed in the heptathlon and decathlon. <!--If you're interested in my track stats, you can find them <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/6995980/RPI/Daniel_Molzahn.html#">here</a> -->. </p>

  <p> Currently, my goal is to get a full-time software engineering position. </p>
