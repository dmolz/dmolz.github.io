  <h1> Daniel Molzahn </h1>
  <h2> Welcome to my website! </h2>
  <p> I'm a junior Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York. </p>
  
  <p> After originally starting as a mechanical engineering major, I realized I had much more interest in programming than I did in engineering, so I switched majors at the end of my sophomore year and haven't looked back since. </p>

  <p> Right now, the goal of this website is to tell a little more about myself and showcase my work and skills. I'd like to definitely keep updating this as I add to my portfolio and become more familiar with HTML and CSS. </p>

  <p> I'm from Monroe, NY, about an hour north of NYC and two hours south of Troy. I played baseball and basketball in high school, and competed in cross country and track as well. I run on the track and field team at RPI, where I compete in the heptathlon and decathlon. If you're interested in my track stats, you can find them <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/6995980/RPI/Daniel_Molzahn.html#">here</a>. </p>

  <p> Currently, my goal is to get a summer 2019 internship. Although I am located in New York, I'm impartial to location because my number one priority is getting a valuable internship and work experience before I graduate. </p>
